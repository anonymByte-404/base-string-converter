```typescript
const main = (): void => {
  inquirer
    .prompt([
      {
        type: 'list',
        name: 'conversionType',
        message: 'Select the type of conversion you want to perform:',
        choices: ['String Conversion', 'Base Conversion'],
      },
    ])
    .then(({ conversionType }) => {
      if (conversionType === 'String Conversion') {
        stringConverter(inquirer, baseChoices, main)
      } else {
        inquirer
          .prompt([
            {
              type: 'list',
              name: 'selectedBase',
              message: 'Choose the target base for conversion:',
              choices: baseChoices,
            },
          ])
          .then(({ selectedBase }) => {
            switch (selectedBase) {
              case 'Base 2':
                binaryConverter(inquirer, main)
                break
              // More base can be added here...
              default:
                console.log(
                  `Conversions for ${selectedBase} are currently not supported.`
                )
            }
          })
          .catch((error) =>
            console.error('An error occurred during base selection:', error)
          )
      }
    })
    .catch((error) =>
      console.error('An error occurred during the initial prompt:', error)
    )
